    loaded once and for all: this means the cache can only grow, and file
    modification after a first caching won't be visible
  * MKDIR / RMDIR The cache is aggressive on two levels:  - File lists are
    never refreshed, so whatever you change has no chance to appear  -
    File contents are loaded once and for all: this means the cache can

    visible
